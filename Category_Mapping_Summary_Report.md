- `motel` → `Landmarks and Outdoors > Tunnel`
- `cottage` → `Landmarks and Outdoors > Cave`

### 2. Over-reliance on Generic Categories
Some FSQ categories are being used too frequently, suggesting the need for more specific mappings.

### 3. Semantic Gaps
Certain OM categories don't have direct equivalents in FSQ, leading to approximate matches with lower confidence scores.

- Quality scoring based on match confidence

## Conclusion

The automated mapping process successfully created initial mappings for all OM categories to FSQ categories. While 38.8% achieved high-quality matches, significant manual review and refinement is recommended for the remaining 61.2% to ensure optimal category alignment for production use.

The mapping provides a solid foundation for POI category standardization between Overture Map and Foursquare systems, with clear guidance on areas requiring additional attention.
